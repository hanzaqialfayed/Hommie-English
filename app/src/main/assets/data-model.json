Sumatran tiger is the smallest tiger of the nine subspecies of tiger. The male Sumatran tiger can grow about 100 kg to 140 kg. Like all tigers, Sumatran tiger also has a thick dark orange coat with thick black stripes. Do you know that no two tigers have the same black stripes? Sadly, Sumatran tigers are now very difficult to find living in the wild. It is said that only around 600 Sumatran tigers live in the wild. Now, the Sumatran tiger is listed as one of the critically endangered animals in the world and may become extinct because their population is decreasing. The population of Sumatran tigers keeps decreasing because of illegal logging and illegal hunting. People cut down the trees in the forests to make oil palm plantatíon. They also burn the forest to clear the land. People also hunt the tigers to get the skin and the fangs and sell it.\n",

This traditional market is not a big market, but we can find lots of things, such as fruits, vegetables, fish, meats, kitchen utensils and other groceries there. The vegetables, fish, chicken, and meat sold there are always fresh. Some people also sell fruits and vegetables that they grow in their own farm. The market opens early in the morning. The sellers usually arrive around 4 in the morning and prepare their goods. What 1 love from traditíonal market ís because most things in here are not expensive. You can even bargain for the price if you buy in large quantity. When I go to the tradítionál market, we often meet with our neighbors or even my classmates or schoolmates.

      "content": "Our Solar System \n  Have you ever been to Planetarium or Bosscha? There, you observe objects in our solar system. In our solar system, the Sun is the biggest object. Sun is a star that provides light and heat for the Earth. There are also eight big objects known as planets. They are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. There are also other space objects, such as dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Among other 8 planets, Mercury is the smallest planet. It is also the closest planet to the Sun. Venus is the hottest planet. It is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and the Moon. The biggest planet is Jupiter and the farthest planet from the Sun is Neptune. Earth is our planet, where living objects can live. It is the third closest planet to the Sun. Some of the planets have satellite, but the Moon is the Earth's satellite. Do you know that every planet in our solar system has seasons? The seasons in other planets are different with the seasons in our Earth. Earth has four seasons; spring, summer, fall, and winter. The differences happen because of the tilt of the planet's axis, the shape of the orbít around the sun, and the atmosphere",
